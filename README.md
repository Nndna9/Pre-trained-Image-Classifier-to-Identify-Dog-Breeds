## Overview 
This project is part of Udacity's 'AI Programming with Python' Nanodegree scholarship by AWS. The goal of this project is to build a pipeline that can classify dog breeds using a pre-trained image classifier.


## Installation

To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Nndna9/Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:

        ```bash
        .\env\Scripts\activate
